## Requirements

| Requirement                                                                                                                                                                                        | Weight |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| Use the fetch API or Axios to communicate with an external web API. Use the data provided by this API to populate your application‚Äôs content and features.                                         | 20%    |
| Create user interaction with the API through a search feature, paginated gallery, or similar. This feature should use GET requests to retrieve associated data.                                    | 15%    |
| Enable user manipulation of data within the API through the use of POST, PUT, or PATCH requests. Ensure your chosen API supports this feature before beginning.                                    | 15%    |
| Make use of Promises and async/await syntax as appropriate.                                                                                                                                        | 15%    |
| Organize your JavaScript code into at least three (3) different module files, and import functions and data across files as necessary.                                                             | 3%     |
| Ensure the program runs as expected, without any undesired behavior caused by misunderstanding of the JavaScript event loop (such as race conditions, API calls being handled out of order, etc.). | 10%    |
| Create an engaging user experience through the use of HTML and CSS.                                                                                                                                | 5%     |
| Ensure that the program runs without errors (comment out things that do not work, and explain your blockers - you can still receive partial credit).                                               | 5%     |
| Commit frequently to the git repository.                                                                                                                                                           | 5%     |
| Include a README file that contains a description of your application.                                                                                                                             | 2%     |
| Level of effort displayed in creativity, presentation, and user experience.                                                                                                                        | 5%     |
